# Local Ray Cluster Configuration for CPU-Only Workloads
# For development and testing without GPU

cluster:
  # Ray head node port
  port: 6379

  # Dashboard configuration
  dashboard:
    enabled: true
    port: 8265

  # Resource configuration for CPU-only workloads
  resources:
    # Number of CPUs
    num_cpus: 8

    # Explicitly set no GPUs
    num_gpus: 0

    # Object store memory for CPU mode
    # Can be smaller for CPU inference
    object_store_memory: 1073741824 # 4294967296  # 4 GB

  # Keep terminal open
  block: false

# Usage Notes:
# - This config is for CPU-only inference
# - Useful for testing and development
# - Small models like TinyLlama work well with CPU
# - Increase num_cpus for better parallelism
